    "# Project 1: Driving Accidents and Drivers' Ages (Work in Groups) #\n",
    "\n",
    "The government is considering to introduce new policies for young drivers (passenger restrictions, night driving restrictions, etc) in order to reduce the number of accidents produced by young drivers. A crucial point in the debate is to have some rigid information about whether the younger age is actually correlated with a higher accident rate. Therefore, they are interested to study such statistics from countries where driving is permitted from a young age and produce data that they can present to the debate.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been tasked to look into the above matter, and after searching open government data you find the following data that relate the driving age with accidents (fatal accidents, or any type of accidents). The data date back in 1998, but are considered representative.\n",
